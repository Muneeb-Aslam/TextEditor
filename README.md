# TextEditor


A Text Editor using a cursor-based list and using a doubly-linked list with header and trailer nodes.
A cursor (indicating the current item) can be moved around the list with the cursor being used to identify the region in the list to be manipulated. We will insert and removing items relative to the current item.
